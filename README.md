# Shape-Detection-opencv-
In this project, various different shapes and polygons like circle,triangle,square,rectangle and star are identified. This was achieved by counting the number of contours, then the number of edges and thereby detecting the shape accordingly. The name of the polygon was also displayed at the center of it by finding locating its centroid.
